I look to common existence and my everyday activities for beauty and inspiration. Simple moments found in and around the spaces we occupy carry the most significance and the highest form of beauty: one whose existence must be noticed carefully. This is where I focus my photography.
 
The struggle to move slowly enough to observe these moments is not one that many have the luxury to surmount. At the heart of my photography is my own appreciation for these precious moments, but ultimately, my work aims to achieve newfound access to what I consider some of the most valuable forms of beauty.
